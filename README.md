# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an assignment for Software Design for Visual Environments

* The goal is to build a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game app that allows users to keep playing by **reusing** the View object
* [java/com/jblearning/tictactoev5](java/com/jblearning/tictactoev5) folder contains all my Java files
* [res](res) folder contains the images and XML files for the UI of this application
* [TicTacToe.java](java/com/jblearning/tictactoev5/TicTacToe.java) implements `TicTacToe` class to play the game and get the results
* [ButtonGridAndTextView.java](java/com/jblearning/tictactoev5/ButtonGridAndTextView.java) implements the **reusable** View for users to play another game after the current one is over
* When the current game is over, the result of the game is shown at the bottom of the screen, and a pop-up window will be triggered to allow users to decide whether to start another one or leave the application.


Below  is a demonstration of running the application on **Android Emulator**
